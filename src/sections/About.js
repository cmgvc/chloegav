            <h1>/about</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Chloe and I'm a student at McGill University pursuing a Bachelor of Science with an expected graduation in 2025.
                I'm completing both a major in Software Engineering as well as in Anatomy and Cell Biology.
                I'm from Ottawa, Ontario and am currently living in Montreal, Quebec. 
                <br /><br />
                Here are some technologies I have worked with:
            </p>   
            <div className="skills">
                <ul className="hover-list">

                        <li key={index}>{tech}</li>
                    ))}
                </ul>
                <ul className="hover-list">
                    {technologiesCol2.map((tech, index) => (
                        <li key={index}>{tech}</li>
                    ))}

                    ))}
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p> 
                Some of my hobbies outside of tech include swimming, reading, finding new music, and learning about car mechanics. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                This year, I've also taken up boxing, which has been a great way to stay active and relieve stress. Additionally, I‚Äôve been diving into DJing, discovering new genres, and curating playlists.
